	<h1 class="title">About</h1>
	<p class="mb-4">
		This blog is co-run by a Cybersecurity Engineer and a Law Student. We bridge
		the gap between technology and regulation by tracking how security practices
		meet legal obligations across the EU and beyond. Our goal is to transform
		dense regulations into practical guidance that engineers, lawyers, founders,
		and compliance teams can actually use.
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		Why we built this: the cybersecurity legal landscape is changing fast
		(NIS2, DORA, CRA, GDPR, eIDAS, and more). Teams often struggle to translate
		high-level texts into day‑to‑day controls, architectures, and processes.
		Here, we summarize the essentials, highlight what really changes for
		organizations, and point to authoritative sources.
	</p>
	<h2 class="title mt-6">Editorial principles</h2>
	<ul class="list-inside list-disc mb-6">
		<li>Accuracy first: we cite primary sources (EUR‑Lex, ENISA, official guidance).</li>
		<li>Actionable: we connect legal requirements to security controls and workflows.</li>
		<li>Neutral and concise: no hype, just what matters for implementation.</li>
		<li>Kept current: we revise posts as standards and guidance evolve.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2 class="title mt-6">What you’ll find</h2>
	<ul class="list-inside list-disc mb-6">
		<li>Plain-language explainers of new and existing EU cybersecurity rules</li>
		<li>Checklists and mappings to frameworks (NIST CSF, ISO/IEC 27001, OWASP)</li>
		<li>Developer- and auditor-friendly interpretations with concrete examples</li>
		<li>Links to official texts on EUR‑Lex and guidance from ENISA and other bodies</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="mb-4">
		Who this is for: security practitioners, product teams, GRC, and legal
		professionals who need clarity quickly. We focus on what’s actionable,
		cite primary sources, and keep content current as guidance evolves.
